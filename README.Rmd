Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.
<br /><br />
Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
<br /><br />
Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
<br /><br />
Features efficient task scheduling, fast inter-process communications, and Transport Layer Security over TCP/IP for remote connections, courtesy of 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
<br /><br />
`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately. 'mirai' (未来 みらい) is Japanese for 'future'.
<br /><br />
[`mirai`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7912722) has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on [`nanonext`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429), a high-performance binding for the 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) C library with zero package dependencies.

### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Use case: minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks concurrently in separate processes.

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) can be performed in parallel on available computing cores.

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai(
  {
    res <- rnorm(n) + m
    res / rev(res)
  },
  m = runif(1),
  n = 1e8
)

m
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA value whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data |> str()
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
```

For easy programmatic use of `mirai()`, '.expr' accepts a pre-constructed language object, and also a list of named arguments passed via '.args'. So, the following would be equivalent to the above:

```{r equiv}
expr <- quote({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
})

args <- list(m = runif(1), n = 1e8)

m <- mirai(.expr = expr, .args = args)

call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
```

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Use case: ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

High-frequency real-time data cannot be written to file/database synchronously without disrupting the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `mirai()` to perform periodic write operations concurrently in a separate process.

Below, '.args' is used to pass a list of objects already present in the calling environment to the mirai by name. This is an alternative use of '.args', and may be combined with `...` to also pass in `name = value` pairs.

```{r exec2}
library(mirai)

x <- rnorm(1e6)
file <- tempfile()

m <- mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), .args = list(x, file))
```

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

`unresolved()` may be used in control flow statements to perform actions which depend on resolution of the 'mirai', both before and after.

This means there is no need to actually wait (block) for a 'mirai' to resolve, as the example below demonstrates.

```{r call2}
# unresolved() queries for resolution itself so no need to use it again within the while loop

while (unresolved(m)) {
  cat("while unresolved\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}

cat("Write complete:", is.null(m$data))

```

Now actions which depend on the resolution may be processed, for example the next write.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Example 3: Resilient Pipelines

Use case: isolating code that can potentially fail in a separate process to ensure continued uptime.

As part of a data science / machine learning pipeline, iterations of model training may periodically fail for stochastic and uncontrollable reasons (e.g. buggy memory management on graphics cards).

Running each iteration in a 'mirai' isolates this potentially-problematic code such that even if it does fail, it does not bring down the entire pipeline.

```{r exec3r}
library(mirai)

run_iteration <- function(i) {
  
  if (runif(1) < 0.1) stop("random error", call. = FALSE) # simulates a stochastic error rate
  sprintf("iteration %d successful\n", i)
  
}

for (i in 1:10) {
  
  m <- mirai(run_iteration(i), .args = list(run_iteration, i))
  while (is_error_value(call_mirai(m)$data)) {
    cat(m$data)
    m <- mirai(run_iteration(i), .args = list(run_iteration, i))
  }
  cat(m$data)
  
}

```

Further, by testing the return value of each 'mirai' for errors, error-handling code is then able to automate recovery and re-attempts, as in the above example. Further details on [error handling](#errors-interrupts-and-timeouts) can be found in the section below.

The end result is a resilient and fault-tolerant pipeline that minimises downtime by eliminating interruptions of long computes.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Daemons: Local Persistent Processes

Daemons, or persistent background processes, may be set to receive 'mirai' requests.

This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be created on an *ad hoc* basis.

#### With Dispatcher (default)

Call `daemons()` specifying the number of daemons to launch.

```{r daemons}
daemons(6)
```

```{r daemons2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```

To view the current status, `status()` provides the number of active connections along with a matrix of statistics for each daemon.

```{r daemons3}
status()
```

The default `dispatcher = TRUE` creates a `dispatcher()` background process that connects to individual daemon processes on the local machine. This ensures that tasks are dispatched efficiently on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis to daemons for processing. Tasks are queued at the dispatcher and sent to a daemon as soon as it can accept the task for immediate execution.

Dispatcher uses synchronisation primitives from [`nanonext`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429), waiting upon rather than polling for tasks, which is efficient both in terms of consuming no resources while waiting, and also being fully synchronised with events (having no latency).

```{r daemons4}
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset. This reverts to the default of creating a new background process for each 'mirai' request.

#### Without Dispatcher

Alternatively, specifying `dispatcher = FALSE`, the background daemons connect directly to the host process. 

```{r daemonsq}
daemons(6, dispatcher = FALSE)
```
```{r daemonsq2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(0.5)
```

Requesting the status now shows 6 connections, along with the host URL at `$daemons`.

```{r daemonsqv}
status()
```

This implementation sends tasks immediately, and ensures that tasks are evenly-distributed amongst daemons. This means that optimal scheduling is not guaranteed as the duration of tasks cannot be known *a priori*. As an example, tasks could be queued at a daemon behind a long-running task, whilst other daemons remain idle.

The advantage of this approach is that it is low-level and does not require an additional dispatcher process. It is well-suited to working with similar-length tasks, or where the number of concurrent tasks typically does not exceed available daemons.

```{r daemons5}
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Distributed Computing: Remote Daemons

The daemons interface may also be used to send tasks for computation to remote daemon processes on the network.

Call `daemons()` specifying 'url' as a character value the host network address and a port that is able to accept incoming connections.

The examples below use an illustrative local network IP address of '10.216.62.86'.

A port on the host machine also needs to be open and available for inbound connections from the local network, illustratively '5555' in the examples below.

IPv6 addresses are also supported and must be enclosed in square brackets `[]` to avoid confusion with the final colon separating the port. For example, port 5555 on the IPv6 address `::ffff:a6f:50d` would be specified as `tcp://[::ffff:a6f:50d]:5555`.

#### Connecting to Remote Daemons Through Dispatcher

The default `dispatcher = TRUE` creates a background `dispatcher()` process on the local machine, which listens to a vector of URLs that remote `daemon()` processes dial in to, with each daemon having its own unique URL.

It is recommended to use a websocket URL starting `ws://` instead of TCP in this scenario (used interchangeably with `tcp://`). A websocket URL supports a path after the port number, which can be made unique for each daemon. In this way a dispatcher can connect to an arbitrary number of daemons over a single port.

```{r localqueue}
daemons(n = 4, url = "ws://10.216.62.86:5555")
```

Above, a single URL was supplied, along with `n = 4` to specify that the dispatcher should listen at 4 URLs. In such a case, an integer sequence is automatically appended to the path `/1` through `/4` to produce these URLs.

Alternatively, supplying a vector of URLs allows the use of arbitrary port numbers / paths, e.g.:

```{r vectorqueue, eval=FALSE}
daemons(url = c("ws://10.216.62.86:5566/cpu", "ws://10.216.62.86:5566/gpu", "ws://10.216.62.86:7788/1"))
```

Above, 'n' is not specified, in which case its value is inferred from the length of the 'url' vector supplied.

--

On the remote resource, `daemon()` may be called from an R session, or directly from a shell using Rscript. Each daemon instance should dial into one of the unique URLs that the dispatcher is listening at:

```
Rscript -e 'mirai::daemon("ws://10.216.62.86:5555/1")'
Rscript -e 'mirai::daemon("ws://10.216.62.86:5555/2")'
Rscript -e 'mirai::daemon("ws://10.216.62.86:5555/3")'
Rscript -e 'mirai::daemon("ws://10.216.62.86:5555/4")'

```

Note that `daemons()` should be set up on the host machine before launching `daemon()` on remote resources, otherwise the daemon instances will exit if a connection is not immediately available. Alternatively, specifying `daemon(asyncdial = TRUE)` will allow daemons to wait (indefinitely) for a connection to become available.

`launch_remote()` may also be used to launch daemons directly on a remote machine. For example, if the remote machine at 10.216.62.100 accepts SSH connections over port 22:

```{r launchremote, eval=FALSE}
launch_remote(1:4, command = "ssh", args = c("-p 22 10.216.62.100", .))
```
```{r launchremotereal, echo=FALSE}
launch_remote(1:4)
```

The returned vector comprises the shell commands executed on the remote machine.

--

Requesting status, on the host machine:

```{r remotev2}
status()
```

As per the local case, `$connections` shows the single connection to dispatcher, however `$daemons` now provides a matrix of statistics for the remote daemons.

- `online` shows as 1 when there is an active connection, or else 0 if a daemon has yet to connect or has disconnected.
- `instance` increments by 1 every time there is a new connection at a URL. This counter is designed to track new daemon instances connecting after previous ones have ended (due to time-outs etc.). 'instance' resets to zero if the URL is regenerated by `saisei()`. 
- `assigned` shows the cumulative number of tasks assigned to the daemon.
- `complete` shows the cumulative number of tasks completed by the daemon.

Dispatcher automatically adjusts to the number of daemons actually connected. Hence it is possible to dynamically scale up or down the number of daemons according to requirements (limited to the 'n' URLs assigned).

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

```{r reset2}
daemons(0)
```

Closing the connection causes the dispatcher to exit automatically, and in turn all connected daemons when their respective connections with the dispatcher are terminated.

#### Connecting to Remote Daemons Directly

By specifying `dispatcher = FALSE`, remote daemons connect directly to the host process. The host listens at a single URL, and distributes tasks to all connected daemons.

```{r remote, eval=FALSE}
daemons(url = "tcp://10.216.62.86:0", dispatcher = FALSE)
```

Alternatively, simply supply a colon followed by the port number to listen on all interfaces on the local host, for example:

```{r remotealt}
daemons(url = "tcp://:0", dispatcher = FALSE)
```

Note that above, the port number is specified as zero. This is a wildcard value that will automatically cause a free ephemeral port to be assigned. The actual assigned port is provided in the return value of the call, or it may be queried at any time via `status()`.

--

On the network resource, `daemon()` may be called from an R session, or an Rscript invocation from a shell. This sets up a remote daemon process that connects to the host URL and receives tasks:

```
Rscript -e 'mirai::daemon("tcp://10.216.62.86:0")'
```
Note that `daemons()` should be set up on the host machine before launching `daemon()` on remote resources, otherwise the daemon instances will exit if a connection is not immediately available. Alternatively, specifying `daemon(asyncdial = TRUE)` will allow daemons to wait (indefinitely) for a connection to become available.

`launch_remote()` may also be used to launch daemons directly on a remote machine. For example, if the remote machine at 10.216.62.100 accepts SSH connections over port 22:

```{r launchremoteu, eval=FALSE}
launch_remote("tcp://10.216.62.86:0", command = "ssh", args = c("-p 22 10.216.62.100", .))
```
```{r launchremoteureal, echo=FALSE}
launch_remote("tcp://10.216.62.86:0")
```

The returned vector comprises the shell commands executed on the remote machine.

--

The number of daemons connecting to the host URL is not limited and network resources may be added or removed at any time, with tasks automatically distributed to all connected daemons.

`$connections` will show the actual number of connected daemons.

```{r remotev}
status()
```

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

```{r reset}
daemons(0)
```

This causes all connected daemons to exit automatically.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Distributed Computing: TLS Secure Connections

TLS can be enabled to secure communications from the local machine to remote daemons.

An automatic zero-configuration default is implemented - all that is required is to specify a secure URL of the form `wss://` or `tls+tcp://`. For example, on the IPv6 loopback address:

```{r tlsremote}
daemons(n = 4, url = "wss://[::1]:5555")
```

Single-use keys and certificates are automatically generated and configured, without requiring any user intervention. The private key is always retained on the host and never transmitted, and also not stored or accessible as an R object.

The generated self-signed certificate is made available for read-only access via `launch_remote()`. This function conveniently constructs the full shell command to launch a daemon, including the correctly specified 'tls' argument to `daemon()`.

```{r launch_remote}
launch_remote(1)
```

The return value may be deployed manually on a remote machine, or directly via SSH or a resource manager by additionally specifying 'command' and 'args' to `launch_remote()`.

__

As an alternative to the automatic process described above, a certificate may also be generated in the traditional manner via a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to a Certificate Authority (CA), which may be a public CA or a CA internal to your organisation.

- The generated certificate along with the associated private key may then be specified as the 'tls' argument to `daemons()`.
- The certificate chain to the CA is supplied as the 'tls' argument to `daemon()`. 

```{r tlsclose, include=FALSE}
daemons(0)
```

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Compute Profiles

The `daemons()` interface also allows the specification of compute profiles for managing tasks with heterogeneous compute requirements:

- send tasks to different daemons or clusters of daemons with the appropriate specifications (in terms of CPUs / memory / GPU / accelerators etc.)
- split tasks between local and remote computation

Simply specify the argument `.compute` when calling `daemons()` with a profile name (which is 'default' for the default profile). The daemons settings are saved under the named profile.

To create a 'mirai' task using a specific compute profile, specify the '.compute' argument to `mirai()`, which defaults to the 'default' compute profile.

Similarly, functions such as `status()`, `launch_local()` or `launch_remote()` should be specified with the desired '.compute' argument.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Errors, Interrupts and Timeouts

If execution in a mirai fails, the error message is returned as a character vector of class 'miraiError' and 'errorValue' to facilitate debugging. `is_mirai_error()` may be used to test for mirai execution errors.

```{r errorexample}
m1 <- mirai(stop("occurred with a custom message", call. = FALSE))
call_mirai(m1)$data

m2 <- mirai(mirai::mirai())
call_mirai(m2)$data

is_mirai_error(m2$data)
is_error_value(m2$data)
```

If during a `call_mirai()` an interrupt e.g. ctrl+c is sent, the mirai will resolve to an empty character vector of class 'miraiInterrupt' and 'errorValue'. `is_mirai_interrupt()` may be used to test for such interrupts. 

```{r interruptexample}
is_mirai_interrupt(m2$data)
```

If execution of a mirai surpasses the timeout set via the '.timeout' argument, the mirai will resolve to an 'errorValue'. This can, amongst other things, guard against mirai processes that have the potential to hang and never return.

```{r timeouts}
m3 <- mirai(nanonext::msleep(1000), .timeout = 500)
call_mirai(m3)$data

is_mirai_error(m3$data)
is_mirai_interrupt(m3$data)
is_error_value(m3$data)
```

`is_error_value()` tests for all mirai execution errors, user interrupts and timeouts. 

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Deferred Evaluation Pipe

`mirai` implements a deferred evaluation pipe `%>>%` for working with potentially unresolved values.

Pipe a 'mirai' or mirai `$data` value forward into a function or series of functions and initially an 'unresolvedExpr' will be returned.

The result may be queried at `$data`, which will return another 'unresolvedExpr' whilst unresolved. However when the original value resolves, the 'unresolvedExpr' will simultaneously resolve into a 'resolvedExpr', for which the evaluated result will then be available at `$data`. 

A piped expression should be wrapped in `.()` to ensure that the return value is always an 'unresolvedExpr' or 'resolvedExpr' as the case may be.

It is possible to use `unresolved()` around an expression, or its `$data` element, to test for resolution, as in the example below.

The pipe operator semantics are similar to R's base pipe `|>`:

`x %>>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`

```{r pipe}
m <- mirai({nanonext::msleep(500); 1})
b <- .(m %>>% c(2, 3) %>>% as.character)

unresolved(b)
b
b$data

nanonext::msleep(1000)
unresolved(b)
b
b$data

```

### Integrations with Crew, Targets, Shiny

The [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) package is a distributed worker-launcher that provides an R6-based interface extending `mirai` to different distributed computing platforms, from traditional clusters to cloud services. The [`crew.cluster`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew.cluster/) package is a plug-in that enables mirai-based workflows on traditional high-performance computing clusters using LFS, PBS/TORQUE, SGE and SLURM.

[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science, has integrated and adopted [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) as its predominant high-performance computing backend.

`mirai` can also serve as the backend for enterprise asynchronous [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) applications in one of two ways:

1. [`mirai.promises`](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai.promises/), which enables a 'mirai' to be used interchangeably with a 'promise' in [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) or [`plumber`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plumber) pipelines; or

2. [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) provides an interface that makes it easy to deploy `mirai` for [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny). The package provides a [Shiny vignette](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/shiny.html) with tutorial and sample code for this purpose.

### Thanks

[William Landau](https://github.com/wlandau/) has been instrumental in shaping development of the package, from being the first to request persistent daemons, through to robustness testing for the high performance computing requirements of [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/).

[Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/) has shared valuable insights leading to the interface accepting broader usage patterns.
