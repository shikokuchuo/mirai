### ミライ
<br />
( 未来 )
<br /><br />
Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
<br /><br />
High performance parallel code execution and distributed computing.
<br /><br />
Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
<br /><br />
Modern networking and concurrency built on [nanonext](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429) and NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) ensures reliable and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.
<br /><br />

> *mirai パッケージを試してみたところ、かなり速くて驚きました*

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

input <- list(x = 2, y = 5, z = double(1e8))

m <- mirai(
  {
    res <- rnorm(1e6, mean = mean, sd = sd)
    max(res) - min(res)
  },
  mean = input$x,
  sd = input$y
)

m
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

To check whether a mirai has resolved:

```{r unres}
unresolved(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data
```

Alternatively, to wait for and collect the result, use the `[]` method:

```{r call}
m[]
```

### Production Usage

### Daemons

Daemons are persistent background processes created to receive 'mirai' requests.

They may be deployed for:

[Local](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#daemons-local-persistent-processes) parallel processing; or

[Remote](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-remote-daemons) network distributed computing.

[Launchers](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-launching-daemons) allow daemons to be started both on the local machine and across the network via SSH etc.

[Secure TLS connections](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-tls-secure-connections) can be automatically-configured on-the-fly for remote daemon connections.

Refer to the [{mirai} vignette](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html) for full package functionality. This may be accessed within R by:

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("mirai", package = "mirai")
```

### Integrations

The following core integrations are documented, with usage examples in the linked vignettes:

[<img alt="R parallel" src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" width="40" height="31" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/parallel.html) &nbsp; Provides an alternative communications backend for R, implementing a low-level feature request by R-Core at R Project Sprint 2023. 'miraiCluster' may also be used with `foreach`, which is supported via `doParallel`.

[<img alt="promises" src="https://docs.posit.co/images/posit-ball.png" width="40" height="36" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/promises.html) &nbsp; Implements the next generation of completely event-driven, non-polling promises. 'mirai' may be used interchageably with 'promises', including with the promise pipe `%...>%`.

[<img alt="Shiny" src="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/shiny.html) &nbsp; Asynchronous parallel / distributed backend, supporting the next level of responsiveness and scalability for Shiny. Launches ExtendedTasks, or plugs directly into the reactive framework for advanced uses.

[<img alt="Plumber" src="https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/images/logo-plumber.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/plumber.html) &nbsp; Asynchronous parallel / distributed backend, capable of scaling Plumber applications in production usage.

[<img alt="Arrow" src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_hex_black-txt_white-bg.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/databases.html) &nbsp; Allows queries using the Apache Arrow format to be handled seamlessly over ADBC database connections hosted in daemon processes.

[<img alt="torch" src="https://torch.mlverse.org/css/images/hex/torch.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/torch.html) &nbsp; Allows Torch tensors and complex objects such as models and optimizers to be used seamlessly across parallel processes.

### Powering Crew and Targets High Performance Computing

[<img alt="targets" src="https://github.com/ropensci/targets/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) &nbsp; Targets, a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science, has integrated and adopted `crew` as its default high-performance computing backend.

[<img alt="crew" src="https://github.com/wlandau/crew/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) &nbsp; Crew is a distributed worker-launcher extending `mirai` to different distributed computing platforms, from traditional clusters to cloud services.

[<img alt="crew.cluster" src="https://github.com/wlandau/crew.cluster/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://wlandau.github.io/crew.cluster/) &nbsp; `crew.cluster` enables mirai-based workflows on traditional high-performance computing clusters using LFS, PBS/TORQUE, SGE and SLURM.

[<img alt="crew.aws.batch" src="https://github.com/wlandau/crew.aws.batch/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://wlandau.github.io/crew.aws.batch/) &nbsp; `crew.aws.batch` extends `mirai` to cloud computing using AWS Batch.

### Thanks

[Daniel Falbel](https://github.com/dfalbel/) for discussion around an efficient solution to serialization and transmission of `torch` tensors.
