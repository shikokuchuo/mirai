### ミライ
<br />
( 未来 )
<br /><br />
Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
<br /><br />
Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously in a parallel process, on the local machine or distributed over the network, with the result automatically available upon completion. 
<br /><br />
Modern networking and concurrency built on [nanonext](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/nanonext/) and [NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org/) (Nanomsg Next Gen) ensures reliable and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.
<br /><br />
Advantages include being inherently queued, allowing the sending of many more tasks than available processes, no arbitrary connection limits, no storage on the file system, support for otherwise non-exportable reference objects, an event-driven 'promises' implementation, and very low overhead.
<br /><br />
Asynchronous parallel map functionality is included.

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

The following expression mimics an expensive calculation that eventually returns a random value.
```{r exec}
library(mirai)

x <- list(time = 2, mean = 4)

m <- mirai({Sys.sleep(time); rnorm(1, mean)}, time = x$time, mean = x$mean)
```
Above, the variables `time` and `mean` in the mirai expression are defined by `name = value` pairs passed as part of the `mirai()` call.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately - creating a mirai never blocks the session.

Whilst the async operation is ongoing, attempting to access a mirai's data yields an 'unresolved' logical NA.
```{r do}
m
m$data
```
To check whether a mirai remains unresolved i.e. its async operation is still ongoing:
```{r unres}
unresolved(m)
```
To wait for and collect the return value, use the mirai's `[]` method:
```{r call}
m[]
```
As a mirai represents an async operation, it is never necessary to wait for it. Other code can continue to be run. Once it completes, the return value automatically becomes available at `$data`.
```{r resolv}
while (unresolved(m)) {
  # do work here that does not depend on 'm'
}
m
m$data
```

#### Daemons

Daemons are persistent background processes for receiving mirai requests, and are created as easily as:

```{r daemons}
daemons(4)
```

Daemons may also be deployed [remotely](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-remote-daemons) for distributed computing and [launchers](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-launching-daemons) can start daemons across the network via (tunnelled) SSH or a cluster resource manager.

[Secure TLS connections](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-tls-secure-connections) can be used for remote daemon connections, with zero configuration required.

#### Async Parallel Map

`mirai_map()` maps a function over a list or vector, with each element processed in a separate parallel process.

```{r map}
m <- mirai_map(
  1:4,
  \(x) {res <- rnorm(1e8, mean = x, sd = x + 3) + z; max(res) - min(res)},
  z = rnorm(1e7)
)
```
A 'mirai_map' object is returned immediately. Other code can continue to run at this point. Its value may be retrieved at any time using its `[]` method to return a list, just like `purrr::map()` or `base::lapply()`.
```{r mapvalue}
m
m[]
```
`mirai_map()` is designed to facilitate recovery from partial failure, and also provides options for early stopping and/or progress indicators. It also has some other [advantages](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#map-functions) over alternative implementations.

### Design Concepts

`mirai` is designed from the ground up to provide a production-grade experience.

- Fast
  + More than 100x faster (lower overhead) than common alternatives <sup>[1]</sup>
  + Built for low-latency applications such as real time inference and Shiny apps

- Reliable
  + Consistent behaviour with no reliance on global options or variables
  + Each mirai call is evaluated explicitly for transparent and predictable results

- Scalable
  + Launch millions of tasks simultaneously over thousands of connections
  + Proven track record handling heavy-duty workloads in the life sciences industry

### Integrations

The following core integrations are documented, with usage examples in the linked vignettes:

[<img alt="R parallel" src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" width="40" height="31" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/parallel.html) &nbsp; Provides an alternative communications backend for R, implementing a new parallel cluster type, a feature request by R-Core at R Project Sprint 2023. 'miraiCluster' may also be used with `foreach` via `doParallel`.

[<img alt="promises" src="https://docs.posit.co/images/posit-ball.png" width="40" height="36" />](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/promises.html) &nbsp; Implements the next generation of completely event-driven, non-polling promises. 'mirai' may be used interchageably with 'promises', including with the promise pipe `%...>%`.
