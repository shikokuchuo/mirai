Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.

未来 みらい mirai is Japanese for 'future'.

Simple and lightweight method for parallelism and concurrent code execution, local or distributed across the network, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) technology.

`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately.

A ‘mirai’ evaluates an arbitrary expression asynchronously, resolving automatically upon completion. The asynchronous task runs in an ephemeral or persistent process, spawned locally or distributed across the network.

{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on {nanonext}, a high-performance binding for the 'NNG' C library with zero package dependencies.

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Use case: minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks concurrently in separate processes.

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) can be performed in parallel on available computing cores.

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
}, n = 1e8, m = runif(1))

m
```

Above, all named objects are passed through to the mirai.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA value whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data |> str()
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
```

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Use case: ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

High-frequency real-time data cannot be written to file/database synchronously without disrupting the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `mirai()` to perform periodic write operations concurrently in a separate process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

Below, `.args` accepts a list of objects already present in the calling environment to be passed to the mirai.

```{r exec2}
library(mirai)

x <- rnorm(1e6)
file <- tempfile()

m <- mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), .args = list(x, file))
```

`unresolved()` may be used in control flow statements to perform actions which depend on resolution of the 'mirai', both before and after.

This means there is no need to actually wait (block) for a 'mirai' to resolve, as the example below demonstrates.

```{r call2}
# unresolved() queries for resolution itself so no need to use it again within the while loop

while (unresolved(m)) {
  cat("while unresolved\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}

cat("Write complete:", is.null(m$data))

```

Now actions which depend on the resolution may be processed, for example the next write.

### Daemons

Daemons or persistent background processes may be set to receive 'mirai' requests.

This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be created on an *ad hoc* basis.

```{r daemons}
# create 8 daemons
daemons(8)

# view the number of active daemons
daemons("view")
```

The current implementation is low-level and ensures tasks are evenly-distributed amongst daemons without actively managing a task queue.

This robust and resource-light approach is particularly well-suited to working with similar-length tasks, or where the number of concurrent tasks typically does not exceed the number of available daemons.

```{r daemons2}
# reset to zero
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero again to revert to the default behaviour of creating a new background process for each 'mirai' request.

### Distributed Computing

Through the `daemons()` interface, tasks may also be sent for computation to server processes on the network.

Specify the '.url' argument as the client network address (or leave blank to listen on all interfaces on the host) and a port that is able to accept incoming connections, for example:

```{r remote}
daemons(.url = "tcp://:5555")
```

The network topology is such that the client listens at the above address, and distributes tasks to all server processes that are connected into it.

On the server, run the following from a suitable shell to set up a remote daemon process (here '192.168.0.2' is the network IP address of the client):

```
Rscript -e 'mirai::.("tcp://192.168.0.2:5555")'
```

Network resources can be added and removed as required. Tasks are automatically distributed to all available server processes.

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

```{r reset}
daemons(NULL)
```

Note: the above warning occurs as no server processes were actually connected in this example.

### Deferred Evaluation Pipe

{mirai} implements a deferred evaluation pipe `%>>%` for working with potentially unresolved values.

Pipe a mirai `$data` value forward into a function or series of functions and it initially returns an 'unresolvedExpr'.

The result may be queried at `$data`, which will return another 'unresolvedExpr' whilst unresolved. However when the original value resolves, the 'unresolvedExpr' will simultaneously resolve into a 'resolvedExpr', for which the evaluated result will be available at `$data`. 

It is possible to use `unresolved()` around a 'unresolvedExpr' or its `$data` element to test for resolution, as in the example below.

The pipe operator semantics are similar to R's base pipe `|>`:

`x %>>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`

```{r pipe}
m <- mirai({Sys.sleep(0.5); 1})
b <- m$data %>>% c(2, 3) %>>% as.character()
b
b$data
Sys.sleep(1)
b$data
b
```

### Errors and Timeouts

If execution in a mirai fails, the error message is returned as a character string of class 'miraiError' and 'errorValue' to facilitate debugging.

```{r errorexample}
m1 <- mirai(stop("occurred with a custom message", call. = FALSE))
cat(call_mirai(m1)$data)

m2 <- mirai(mirai())
cat(call_mirai(m2)$data)

is_mirai_error(m2$data)
is_error_value(m2$data)
```

If execution of a mirai surpasses the timeout set via the `.timeout` argument, the mirai will resolve to an `errorValue`. This can, amongst other things, guard against mirai processes that hang and never return.

```{r timeouts}
m3 <- mirai(nanonext::msleep(1000), .timeout = 500)
call_mirai(m3)$data

is_mirai_error(m3$data)
is_error_value(m3$data)
```

`is_error_value()` tests for both mirai execution errors and timeouts. `is_mirai_error()` tests for just mirai execution errors.
