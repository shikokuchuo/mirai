Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.
<br /><br />
Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
<br /><br />
Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
<br /><br />
`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately. 'mirai' (未来 みらい) is Japanese for 'future'.
<br /><br />
Efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or secure TLS connections over TCP/IP, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
<br /><br />
{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on [`nanonext`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429), a high-performance binding for the 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) C library with zero package dependencies.
<br /><br />

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai(
  {
    res <- rnorm(x) + y ^ 2
    res / rev(res)
  },
  x = 11,
  y = runif(1)
)

m
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

To check whether a mirai has resolved:

```{r unres}
unresolved(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data
```

### Vignette

See the [mirai vignette](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html) for full package functionality.

Key topics include:

- Example use cases

- Local daemons - persistent background processes

- Distributed computing - remote daemons

- Secure TLS connections

This may be accessed within R by:

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("mirai", package = "mirai")
```

### Use with Parallel and Foreach

{mirai} provides an alternative communications backend for R's base 'parallel' package.

`make_cluster()` creates a 'miraiCluster', a cluster fully compatible with all 'parallel' functions such as:

- `parallel::clusterApply()`
- `parallel::parLapply()`
- `parallel::parLapplyLB()`

[`doParallel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=doParallel) can also register a 'miraiCluster' for use with the [`foreach`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) package.

This functionality fulfils a request from R-Core at R Project Sprint 2023.

### Use with Crew and Targets

The [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) package is a distributed worker-launcher extending {mirai} to different distributed computing platforms, from traditional clusters to cloud services.

[`crew.cluster`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew.cluster) is a plug-in that enables mirai-based workflows on traditional high-performance computing clusters using:

- LFS
- PBS/TORQUE
- SGE
- SLURM

[`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=targets), a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science, has integrated and adopted [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) as its default recommended high-performance computing backend.

### Use with Shiny and Plumber

{mirai} serves as a backend for enterprise asynchronous [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) or [`plumber`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plumber) applications.

A 'mirai' may be used interchangeably with a 'promise' by using the the promise pipe `%...>%`, or explictly by `promises::as.promise()`, allowing side-effects to be performed upon asynchronous resolution of a 'mirai'.

Alternatively, [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) also provides an interface that facilitates deploying {mirai} for [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny), and provides a [Shiny vignette](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/shiny.html) with tutorial and sample code for this purpose.

### Thanks

We would like to thank in particular:

[William Landau](https://github.com/wlandau/), for being instrumental in shaping development of the package, from initiating the original request for persistent daemons, through to orchestrating robustness testing for the high performance computing requirements of [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) and [`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=targets).

[Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/), for valuable and incisive insights leading to the interface accepting broader usage patterns.

[Luke Tierney](https://github.com/ltierney/), R Core, for introducing R's implementation of L'Ecuyer-CMRG streams, used to ensure statistical independence in parallel processing.
