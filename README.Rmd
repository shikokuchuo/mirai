Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.

Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.

Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.

Features efficient task scheduling, scalability beyond R connection limits, and transports faster than TCP/IP for inter-process communications, courtesy of 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).

`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately. 'mirai' (未来 みらい) is Japanese for 'future'.

{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on {nanonext}, a high-performance binding for the 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) C library with zero package dependencies.

### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Use case: minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks concurrently in separate processes.

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) can be performed in parallel on available computing cores.

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
}, m = runif(1), n = 1e8)

m
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA value whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data |> str()
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
```

For easy programmatic use of `mirai()`, '.expr' accepts a pre-constructed language object, and also a list of named arguments passed via '.args'. So, the following would be equivalent to the above:

```{r equiv}
expr <- quote({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
})

args <- list(m = runif(1), n = 1e8)

m <- mirai(.expr = expr, .args = args)

call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
```

### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Use case: ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

High-frequency real-time data cannot be written to file/database synchronously without disrupting the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `mirai()` to perform periodic write operations concurrently in a separate process.

Below, '.args' is used to pass a list of objects already present in the calling environment to the mirai by name. This is an alternative use of '.args', and may be combined with `...` to also pass in `name = value` pairs.

```{r exec2}
library(mirai)

x <- rnorm(1e6)
file <- tempfile()

m <- mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), .args = list(x, file))
```

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

`unresolved()` may be used in control flow statements to perform actions which depend on resolution of the 'mirai', both before and after.

This means there is no need to actually wait (block) for a 'mirai' to resolve, as the example below demonstrates.

```{r call2}
# unresolved() queries for resolution itself so no need to use it again within the while loop

while (unresolved(m)) {
  cat("while unresolved\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}

cat("Write complete:", is.null(m$data))

```

Now actions which depend on the resolution may be processed, for example the next write.

### Example 3: Resilient Pipelines

Use case: isolating code that can potentially fail in a separate process to ensure continued uptime.

As part of a data science / machine learning pipeline, iterations of model training may periodically fail for stochastic and uncontrollable reasons (e.g. buggy memory management on graphics cards).

Running each iteration in a 'mirai' isolates this potentially-problematic code such that even if it does fail, it does not bring down the entire pipeline.

```{r exec3r}
library(mirai)

run_iteration <- function(i) {
  
  if (runif(1) < 0.1) stop("random error", call. = FALSE) # simulates a stochastic error rate
  sprintf("iteration %d successful", i)
  
}

for (i in 1:10) {
  
  m <- mirai(run_iteration(i), .args = list(run_iteration, i))
  while (is_error_value(call_mirai(m)$data)) {
    cat(m$data, "\n")
    m <- mirai(run_iteration(i), .args = list(run_iteration, i))
  }
  cat(m$data, "\n")
  
}

```

Further, by testing the return value of each 'mirai' for errors, error-handling code is then able to automate recovery and re-attempts, as in the above example. Further details on [error handling](#errors-interrupts-and-timeouts) can be found in the section below.

The end result is a resilient and fault-tolerant pipeline that minimises downtime by eliminating interruptions of long computes.

### Daemons: Local Persistent Processes

Daemons, or persistent background processes, may be set to receive 'mirai' requests.

This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be created on an *ad hoc* basis.

#### With Dispatcher (default)

Call `daemons()` specifying the number of daemons to launch.

```{r daemons}
daemons(6)
```

```{r daemons2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```

To view the current status, call `daemons()` with no arguments. This provides the number of active connections along with a matrix of statistics for each daemon.

```{r daemons3}
daemons()
```

The default `dispatcher = TRUE` creates a `dispatcher()` background process that connects to individual daemon processes on the local machine on behalf of the client. This ensures that tasks are dispatched efficiently on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis to servers for processing. Tasks are queued at the dispatcher and sent to a daemon as soon as it can accept the task for immediate execution.

```{r daemons4}
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset. This reverts to the default of creating a new background process for each 'mirai' request.

#### Without Dispatcher

Alternatively, specifying `dispatcher = FALSE`, the background daemon processes connect directly to the client. 

```{r daemonsq}
daemons(6, dispatcher = FALSE)
```
```{r daemonsq2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(0.5)
```

Requesting the status now shows 6 connections and 6 daemons.

```{r daemonsqv}
daemons()
```

This implementation sends tasks immediately, and ensures that tasks are evenly-distributed amongst daemons. This means that optimal scheduling is not guaranteed as the duration of tasks cannot be known *a priori*. As an example, tasks could be queued at a daemon behind a long-running task, whilst other daemons remain idle.

The advantage of this approach is that it is low-level and does not require an additional dispatcher process. It is well-suited to working with similar-length tasks, or where the number of concurrent tasks typically does not exceed available daemons.

```{r daemons5}
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Distributed Computing: Remote Servers

The daemons interface may also be used to send tasks for computation to server processes on the network.

Call `daemons()` specifying 'url' as a character string the client network address and a port that is able to accept incoming connections.

The examples below use an illustrative local network IP address of '10.111.5.13'.

A port on the client also needs to be open and available for inbound connections from the local network, illustratively '5555' in the examples below.

#### Connecting to Remote Servers Through Dispatcher

The default `dispatcher = TRUE` creates a background `dispatcher()` process on the local client machine, which listens to a vector of URLs that remote `server()` processes dial in to, with each server having its unique URL.

It is recommended to use a websocket URL starting `ws://` instead of TCP in this scenario (used interchangeably with `tcp://`). A websocket URL supports a path after the port number, which can be made unique for each server. In this way a dispatcher can connect to an arbitrary number of servers over a single port.

```{r localqueue}
# daemons(n = 4, url = "ws://10.111.5.13:5555")

daemons(n = 4, url = "ws://:5555")
```

Above, a single URL was supplied, along with `n = 4` to specify that the dispatcher should listen at 4 URLs. In such a case, an integer sequence is automatically appended to the path `/1` through `/4` to produce these URLs.

Alternatively, supplying a vector of URLs allows the use of arbitrary port numbers / paths, e.g.:

```{r vectorqueue}
# daemons(url = c("ws://:5555/cpu", "ws://:5555/gpu", "ws://:12560", "ws://:12560/2"))
```

Above, 'n' is not specified, in which case its value is inferred from the length of the 'url' vector supplied.

--

On the remote resource, `server()` may be called from an R session, or directly from a shell using Rscript. Each server instance should dial into one of the unique URLs that the dispatcher is listening to:

```
Rscript -e 'mirai::server("ws://10.111.5.13:5555/1")'
Rscript -e 'mirai::server("ws://10.111.5.13:5555/2")'
Rscript -e 'mirai::server("ws://10.111.5.13:5555/3")'
Rscript -e 'mirai::server("ws://10.111.5.13:5555/4")'

```
```{r remotes2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```

--

Requesting status, on the client:

```{r remotev2}
daemons()
```

As per the local case, `$connections` will show the single connection to the dispatcher process, however `$daemons` will provide the matrix of statistics for the remote servers.

`online` shows as 1 when there is an active connection, or else 0 if a server has yet to connect or has disconnected.

`instance` will increment by 1 every time there is a new connection at a URL. When this happens, the `assigned` and `complete` statistics will also reset. This is designed to track new server instances connecting after previous ones have ended (due to time-outs etc.).

`assigned` shows the cumulative number of tasks assigned to the server instance by the dispatcher.

`complete` shows the cumulative number of tasks completed by the server instance.

The dispatcher will automatically adjust to the number of servers actually connected. Hence it is possible to dynamically scale up or down the number of servers according to requirements (limited to the 'n' URLs assigned at the dispatcher).

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

```{r reset2}
daemons(0)
```

Closing the connection causes the dispatcher to exit automatically, and in turn all connected servers when their respective connections with the dispatcher are terminated.

#### Connecting to Remote Servers Directly

By specifying `dispatcher = FALSE`, remote servers connect directly to the client. The client listens at a single URL address, and distributes tasks to all connected server processes.

```{r remote, eval=FALSE}
daemons(url = "tcp://10.111.5.13:0", dispatcher = FALSE)
```

```{r remotes3, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(0.5)
```

Alternatively, simply supply a colon followed by the port number to listen on all interfaces on the local host, for example:

```{r remotealt}
daemons(url = "tcp://:0", dispatcher = FALSE)
```

Note that above, the port number is specified as zero. This is a wildcard value that will automatically cause a free ephemeral port to be assigned. The actual assigned port is provided as the return value of the call, or it may be queried at any time by requesting the status via `daemons()`.

--

On the server, `server()` may be called from an R session, or an Rscript invocation from a shell. This sets up a remote daemon process that connects to the client URL and receives tasks:

```
Rscript -e 'mirai::server("tcp://10.111.5.13:0")'
```

--

The number of daemons connecting to the client URL is not limited and network resources may be added or removed at any time, with tasks automatically distributed to all server processes.

`$connections` will show the actual number of connected server instances.

```{r remotes, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```
```{r remotev}
daemons()
```

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

```{r reset}
daemons(0)
```

This causes all connected server instances to exit automatically.

### Compute Profiles

The `daemons()` interface also allows the specification of compute profiles for managing tasks with heterogeneous compute requirements:

- send tasks to different servers or server clusters with the appropriate specifications (in terms of CPUs / memory / GPU / accelerators etc.)
- split tasks between local and remote computation

Simply specify the argument `.compute` when calling `daemons()` with a profile name (which is 'default' for the default profile). The daemons settings are saved under the named profile.

To launch a 'mirai' task using a specific compute profile, specify the '.compute' argument to `mirai()`, which defaults to the 'default' compute profile.

### Errors, Interrupts and Timeouts

If execution in a mirai fails, the error message is returned as a character string of class 'miraiError' and 'errorValue' to facilitate debugging. `is_mirai_error()` can be used to test for mirai execution errors.

```{r errorexample}
m1 <- mirai(stop("occurred with a custom message", call. = FALSE))
call_mirai(m1)$data

m2 <- mirai(mirai::mirai())
call_mirai(m2)$data

is_mirai_error(m2$data)
is_error_value(m2$data)
```

If during a `call_mirai()` an interrupt e.g. ctrl+c is sent, the mirai will resolve to an empty character string of class 'miraiInterrupt' and 'errorValue'. `is_mirai_interrupt()` may be used to test for such interrupts. 

```{r interruptexample}
is_mirai_interrupt(m2$data)
```

If execution of a mirai surpasses the timeout set via the '.timeout' argument, the mirai will resolve to an 'errorValue'. This can, amongst other things, guard against mirai processes that hang and never return.

```{r timeouts}
m3 <- mirai(nanonext::msleep(1000), .timeout = 500)
call_mirai(m3)$data

is_mirai_error(m3$data)
is_mirai_interrupt(m3$data)
is_error_value(m3$data)
```

`is_error_value()` tests for all mirai execution errors, user interrupts and timeouts.

### Deferred Evaluation Pipe

{mirai} implements a deferred evaluation pipe `%>>%` for working with potentially unresolved values.

Pipe a 'mirai' or mirai `$data` value forward into a function or series of functions and it initially returns an 'unresolvedExpr'.

The result may be queried at `$data`, which will return another 'unresolvedExpr' whilst unresolved. However when the original value resolves, the 'unresolvedExpr' will simultaneously resolve into a 'resolvedExpr', for which the evaluated result will be available at `$data`. 

A piped expression should be wrapped in `resolve()` to ensure that the return value is always an 'unresolvedExpr' or 'resolvedExpr' as the case may be.

It is possible to use `unresolved()` around a 'unresolvedExpr' or its `$data` element to test for resolution, as in the example below.

The pipe operator semantics are similar to R's base pipe `|>`:

`x %>>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`

```{r pipe}
m <- mirai({nanonext::msleep(500); 1})
b <- resolve(m %>>% c(2, 3) %>>% as.character)
b
b$data
nanonext::msleep(800)
b$data
b
```
