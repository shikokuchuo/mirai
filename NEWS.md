# mirai 0.7.2.9002 (development)

* `daemons()` interface has been simplified with a `...` argument.
  + Allows calling with a second argument `q` for running an active queue (task scheduler).
  + Calling with a logical argument provides an improved method for viewing the current number of daemons / active connections, replacing the previous `daemons("view")` functionality.
* `server()` gains the argument 'n' for launching an actively-managed cluster of daemons on remote resources.
* `eval_mirai()` is now removed as an alias for `mirai()`.
* Invalid URLs provided to `server()` and `daemons()` now error and return in a timely fashion instead of potentially causing a hang.
* Requires nanonext >= 0.7.3.9002 and R >= 3.5.
* Internal performance enhancements.

# mirai 0.7.2

* Internal performance enhancements.

# mirai 0.7.1

* Allow user interrupts of `call_mirai()` again (regression in 0.7.0), now returning a 'miraiInterrupt'.
* Adds auxiliary function `is_mirai_interrupt()` to test if an object is a 'miraiInterrupt'.
* Requires nanonext >= 0.7.0: returned 'errorValues' e.g. mirai timeouts are no longer accompanied by warnings.
* Internal performance enhancements.

# mirai 0.7.0

* `daemons()` now takes 'n' and '.url' arguments. '.url' is an optional client URL allowing mirai tasks to be distributed across the network. Compatibility with existing interface is retained.
* The server function `server()` is exported for creating daemon / ephemeral processes on network resources.
* Mirai errors are formatted better and now print to stdout rather than stderr.
* Improvements to performance and stability requiring nanonext >= 0.6.0.
* Internal enhancements to error handling in a mirai / daemon process.

# mirai 0.6.0

* Notice: older package versions will no longer be supported by 'nanonext' >= 0.6.0. Please ensure you are using the latest version of 'mirai' or else refrain from upgrading 'nanonext'.
* Internal enhancements to `daemons()` and `%>>%` deferred evaluation pipe.

# mirai 0.5.3

* `mirai()` gains a '.args' argument for passing a list of objects already in the calling environment, allowing for example `mirai(func(x, y, z), .args = list(x, y, z))` rather than having to specify `mirai(func(x, y, z), x = x, y = y, z = z)`.
* Errors from inside a mirai will now return the error message as a character string of class 'miraiError' and 'errorValue', rather than just a nul byte. Utility function `is_mirai_error()` should be used in place of `is_nul_byte()`, which is no longer re-exported.
* `is_error_value()` can be used to test for all errors, including timeouts where the '.timeout' argument has been used.
* All re-exports from 'nanonext' have been brought in-package for better documentation.

# mirai 0.5.2

* Internal optimisations requiring nanonext >= 0.5.2.

# mirai 0.5.0

* Implements the `%>>%` deferred evaluation pipe.
* Adds '.timeout' argument to `mirai()` to ensure a mirai always resolves even if the child process crashes etc.

# mirai 0.4.1

* Exits cleanly when daemons have not been explicitly zeroed prior to ending an R session.
* Fixes possible hang on Windows when shutting down daemons.

# mirai 0.4.0

* Back to a pure R implementation thanks to enhanced internal design at nanonext.
* Adds auxiliary function `is_mirai()` to test if an object is a mirai.
* Versioning system to synchronise with nanonext e.g. v0.4.x requires nanonext >= 0.4.0.

# mirai 0.2.0

* The value of a mirai is now stored at `$data` to optimally align with the underlying implementation.
* Package now contains C code (requires compilation), using weak references for simpler management of resources.
* Switch to abstract sockets on Linux.

# mirai 0.1.1

* `mirai()` added as an alias for `eval_mirai()`; supports evaluating arbitrary length expressions wrapped in `{}`.
* A mirai now resolves automatically without requiring `call_mirai()`. Access the `$value` directly and an ‘unresolved’ logical NA will be returned if the async operation is yet to complete.
* `stop_mirai()` added as a function to stop evaluation of an ongoing async operation.
* Auxiliary functions `is_nul_byte()` and `unresolved()` re-exported from {nanonext} to test for evaluation errors and resolution of a 'mirai' respectively.
* New `daemons()` interface to set and manage persistent background processes for receiving 'mirai' requests.

# mirai 0.1.0

* Initial release.
