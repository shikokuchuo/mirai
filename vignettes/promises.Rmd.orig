### Promises Integration

`mirai` supplies its own `as.promise()` method, allowing it to be used as a promise from the [`promises`](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/) package.

These are next-generation, event-driven promises, developed in collaboration with Joe Cheng.

- Do not require each promise to be polled for completion by a `later` loop like other promises.
- Instead, promise actions are automatically queued for execution as soon as each 'mirai' resolves.
- Allows for much higher responsiveness (lower latency) and massive scalability (situations with thousand of promises or more).

A 'mirai' may be piped directly using the promise pipe `&...>%`, which implicitly calls `as.promise()` on the 'mirai'. Similarly all promise-aware functions such as `promises::then()` or `shiny::ExtendedTask$new()` which take a promise can also take a 'mirai' (using `promises` >= 1.3.0).

Alternatively, a 'mirai' may be explicitly converted into a promise by `as.promise()`, which then allows using the methods `$then()`, `$finally()` etc.

The following example outputs "hello" to the console after one second when the 'mirai' resolves.
```{r promises}
library(mirai)
library(promises)

p <- mirai({Sys.sleep(1); "hello"}) %...>% cat()
p
```
It is possible to both access a 'mirai' value at `$data` and to use a promise for enacting a side effect (assigning the value to an environment in the example below).
```{r promisesalt}
library(mirai)

env <- new.env()

m <- mirai({
  Sys.sleep(1)
  "hello"
})

promises::then(m, function(x) env$res <- x)

call_mirai(m)$data
```
After returning to the top level prompt:

```{r promisesaltcont}
env$res
```
