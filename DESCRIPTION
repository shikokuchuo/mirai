Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 1.2.0.9027
Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network, with the result automatically available upon completion. Modern
    networking and concurrency built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen)
    ensure reliable and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS. Advantages include being inherently
    queued thus handling many more tasks than available processes, no storage on
    the file system, support for otherwise non-exportable reference objects, an
    event-driven promises implementation, and built-in asynchronous parallel
    map.
