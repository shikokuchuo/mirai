Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 1.1.0.9005
Description: High performance parallel code execution and distributed computing.
    Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
    on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Modern networking and concurrency built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg
    Next Gen) ensures reliable and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.
