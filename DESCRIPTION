Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 0.8.2.9023
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
    Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
    on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Features efficient task scheduling, scalability beyond R connection limits,
    and transports faster than TCP/IP for inter-process communications, courtesy
    of 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) technology.
